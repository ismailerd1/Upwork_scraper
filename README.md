# Upwork_scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper that searches for job postings on Upwork, filters them based on their post time, and sends email notifications for new job listings. It uses Selenium for web scraping, regular expressions for filtering job posts by time, and SMTP for sending emails. You can change the url and e-mail section and use it according to your own wishes.
